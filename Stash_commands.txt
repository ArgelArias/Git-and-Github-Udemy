#stash helps you to save the changes that are not ready to commit
#when you need to move to another branch for whatever reason

#it will save the staged and unstaged changes,
#reverting the changes on the working copy

#stash the current changes on the branch
git stash save
#or only
git stash

#recover the changes from the stash
git stash pop

#apply the stashed changes on the current branch but without remove them from the stash
git stash apply

------------------------MULTIPLE STASHING----------------------
#you can continue doing git stash and it will create a queue of stashes

#list the queue of stashes
git stash list

#to apply any stash from the queue
git stash apply [stashID]
#for example
git stash apply stash@{2}

#dropping stashes
#drop the desired stash
git stash drop [stashID]
#for example
git stash drop stash@{2}

#crear all the stash queue
git stash clear
